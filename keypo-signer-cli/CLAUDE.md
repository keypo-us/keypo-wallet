## Project Overview

keypo-signer is a macOS CLI tool that manages P-256 signing keys inside the Apple Secure Enclave. It creates keys, signs data, rotates keys, and deletes keys. It outputs JSON by default. It is deliberately minimal — it signs bytes and returns signatures, nothing else.

The full specification is in `../docs/archive/specs/keypo-signer-spec.md`. That document is the source of truth for all behavior, output formats, exit codes, and test cases. Read it before making changes.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift
- **Build system**: Swift Package Manager
- **Minimum deployment**: macOS 14 (Sonoma), Apple Silicon only (arm64)
- **Frameworks**: CryptoKit, Security, LocalAuthentication, Foundation
- **External dependency**: swift-argument-parser (Apple)
- **No other external dependencies**

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build
swift build

# Build release
swift build -c release

# Run
swift run keypo-signer <command>

# Run tests
swift test
```

## Architecture Rules

1. **KeypoCore is the library, keypo-signer is the thin CLI wrapper.** All Secure Enclave operations, metadata management, and signature formatting live in KeypoCore. The executable target only handles argument parsing and output formatting. This separation exists so a future GUI app or server mode can reuse KeypoCore.

2. **CryptoKit for signing, Security framework for key lifecycle.** Use `SecureEnclave.P256.Signing.PrivateKey` from CryptoKit for signing operations (it accepts pre-hashed input, avoiding double-hash). Use Security framework (`SecItemAdd`, `SecItemCopyMatching`, `SecItemDelete`) for key storage and lookup in the Keychain. Use `SecAccessControlCreateWithFlags` for policy creation.

3. **Pre-hashed signing only.** The CLI accepts hex-encoded data and signs it directly. No hashing is applied by the tool. This is critical — callers pass already-hashed data and double-hashing would break verification.

4. **Low-S normalization is mandatory.** After every sign operation, check if s > curve_order/2 and replace with curve_order - s if so. The P-256 curve order is `0xFFFFFFFF00000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFBCE6FAADA7179E84F3B9CAC2FC632551`.

5. **Three access control policies: open, passcode, biometric.** These map to SecAccessControl flags. The policy is set at key creation and is immutable. Only signing is gated by the policy (hardware-enforced). Delete and rotate are not gated by the key's policy.

6. **Metadata is a JSON file, not a database.** `~/.keypo/keys.json` stores key labels, public keys, policies, counters. No secret material. Config dir is 700, file is 600.

7. **Application tags follow the pattern `com.keypo.signer.<label>`.** This is how we look up SE keys in the Keychain.

## Coding Conventions

- Use Foundation's `JSONEncoder` / `JSONDecoder` for all JSON. Set `outputFormatting` to `[.prettyPrinted, .sortedKeys]` for JSON output mode.
- All errors go to stderr. All structured output goes to stdout.
- Exit codes are specified per-command in the spec. Use them exactly.
- Label validation: lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens, must start with a letter, 1-64 chars. Regex: `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$`
- Public keys are output as uncompressed hex with `0x04` prefix (130 hex chars total).
- Signatures are output as hex with `0x` prefix.
- Timestamps are ISO 8601 with timezone (use `ISO8601DateFormatter`).
- The `--format raw` flag outputs bare hex with no newline wrapper or JSON.
- The `--format pretty` flag outputs human-readable text, not JSON.
- Handle errors gracefully — never crash on bad input, missing files, or missing SE keys.

## Key Gotchas

- **SecKeyCreateSignature hashes the input.** Do NOT use it. Use CryptoKit's `SecureEnclave.P256.Signing.PrivateKey.signature(for:)` instead. This is the single most important implementation detail.
- **SecItemDelete does not respect the key's access control policy.** Any process that knows the application tag can delete a key. This is by design — we don't gate delete behind the key's policy.
- **ECDSA signatures are non-deterministic.** Signing the same data twice produces different signatures. Both are valid. Tests must account for this.
- **`.biometryCurrentSet` invalidates the key if biometrics change.** If a user re-enrolls their fingerprint, biometric-policy keys become permanently inaccessible. This is intentional Apple behavior.
- **Concurrent metadata writes.** Multiple signing processes can run in parallel. The metadata file (signing counters) needs atomic write handling — write to a temp file, then rename.
- **SE key lookup.** Use `SecItemCopyMatching` with `kSecAttrApplicationTag` set to `com.keypo.signer.<label>` to find keys. Set `kSecAttrTokenID` to `kSecAttrTokenIDSecureEnclave` to ensure we only match SE keys.

## Testing

Tests are defined in ../docs/archive/specs/keypo-signer-spec.md. **You MUST pass ALL tests in Categories 1-6 before the implementation is considered complete.** These are automated tests using open-policy keys and can run without human interaction. Do not move on to new features or optimizations until every test in Categories 1-6 passes.

Category 7 requires human interaction (passcode and biometric policies) and will be run manually by the developer.

For unit tests in `KeypoCoreTests`, use `--config` to isolate test state in a temp directory. Prefix all test key labels with `test-`.

The two most critical tests are:
1. **T2.2** — Signature verifies with an external tool (openssl or Python ecdsa). This proves standards compliance.
2. **T6.7** — Cross-verification with openssl. Same idea but with explicit PEM conversion steps.

If these two tests pass, the signing output is correct.

## Distribution

- Homebrew tap: `keypo/homebrew-tap`
- Binary: arm64 only (Apple Silicon required for SE)
- Code-signed and notarized for Gatekeeper
- Formula test: `keypo-signer info --system` (works without SE)
