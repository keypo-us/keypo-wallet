# keypo-wallet

A CLI that turns your Mac into a programmable hardware wallet. Key features:

- Create wallets with different signing policies: touchID, passcode or no policy. We use raw passkeys (P-256) with the ability to extend functionality to webauthn.
- All wallet private keys are hardware bound: they never leave your mac's secure enclave. Apple can't even extract them.
- Under the hood: the wallet's use EIP-7702 (smart account) delegation. To start we are using [Open Zeppelin's implementation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/accounts) but this can be extended to any programmable logic you can think of. Please refer to [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for more detailed information.
- The product has 0 centralized dependencies. Key management happens locally using your secure enclave, smart contracts manage policies how how your keys can be used and an account abstraction (ERC-4337) bundler submits your transactions on your behalf. The example implementation uses Pimlico bundlers but the CLI is compatible with any popular bundler (Coinbase, Alchemy, etc). 

## Monorepo Structure

| Directory | Description |
|---|---|

| `keypo-wallet/` | Rust crate + CLI — account setup, signing, bundler interaction |
| `keypo-signer-cli/` | Swift CLI — Secure Enclave P-256 key management (macOS) |
| `homebrew/` | Homebrew tap formula for keypo-signer |
| `deployments/` | Per-chain deployment records (JSON) |
| `docs/` | Architecture, conventions, ADRs, setup, deployment -- see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for full index |

## Prerequisites

- **macOS with Apple Silicon** — required for Secure Enclave signing via `keypo-signer`
- **Rust 1.91+** — only needed if building from source ([install](https://rustup.rs/))

## Getting Started

### 0. Prerequisites

You'll need the following set up before installing the CLI:

- An RPC provider URL. To start you can use the Base public RPC (https://sepolia.base.org) but there are many RPC providers you can use.
- A bundler API key/URL. Lots of options here, the most popular being CDP, Alchemy and Pimlico. We used Pimlico, but any ERC4337 bundler works.
- A paymaster API key/URL (optional). If you want to sponsor gas you'll need to set this up. Most bundler platforms give you the paymaster with the same URL/API key.
- A small amount of ETH (~$2) in a seperate wallet. This is needed for paying gas to deploy the wallet during the initial setup.

### 1. Install

```bash
# Via Homebrew (installs both keypo-wallet and keypo-signer)
brew install keypo-us/tap/keypo-wallet

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/keypo-us/keypo-wallet.git
cd keypo-wallet/keypo-wallet && cargo install --path .
# (keypo-signer must be installed separately: brew install keypo-us/tap/keypo-signer)
```

### 2. Configure endpoints

```bash
keypo-wallet init
# Prompts for RPC URL, bundler URL, and optional paymaster URL (if you want to sponsor the wallet's gas payments).
# Saves to ~/.keypo/config.toml — no need to pass --rpc/--bundler on every command.
```

### 3. Set up a smart account

```bash
keypo-wallet setup --key my-key --key-policy my-policy
```

This signs an EIP-7702 delegation to the KeypoAccount contract and registers your P-256 (passkey) public key as the owner. The account record is saved to `~/.keypo/accounts.json`.

**my-key** is set by the user and is the wallet identifier after setup. 

**my-policy** is the signing policy you are setting for the wallet. Options are:

- open: No restrictions on signing transactions. Best for automated tasks like giving an AI agent access to a wallet.
- passcode: All transaction signing requires entering the passcode associated with the Apple ID registered to the local Mac device. 
- bio: All transaction signing requires touchID. 

**Funding:** Setup requires a small amount of ETH for gas. The CLI prints the address and waits for you to send ETH manually. You should only need to send ~$1 of ETH. 

### 4. Check wallet configuration

```bash
keypo-wallet wallet-info --key my-key
```

Shows wallet address, key policy, P-256 public key, chain deployments and live ETH balance per chain.

Grabbing live ETH balance requires an RPC call, so the command could take a few seconds to complete. If you want faster info without getting live on-chain data, you can run:

```bash
keypo-wallet info --key my-key
```

Gives you everything that wallet-info gives (wallet address, key policy, P-256 public key and chain deployments) except live ETH balance per chain. 

You can also run:
```bash
keypo-wallet balance --key my-key        # ETH balance
keypo-wallet balance --key my-key --token 0xTokenContractAddress  # ERC-20 balance
```

### 5. Send a transaction

```bash
# Send 0.001 ETH (value is in wei)
keypo-wallet send --key my-key --to 0xRecipientAddress --value 1000000000000000
```

If `paymaster_url` is set in your config, transactions are gas-sponsored automatically — the paymaster pays for gas so your wallet doesn't need ETH for fees. To explicitly skip the paymaster and pay gas from your wallet's ETH balance, add `--no-paymaster`.

## Development

```bash
# Rust (keypo-wallet)
cd keypo-wallet && cargo check
cd keypo-wallet && cargo test
cd keypo-wallet && cargo build

# Swift (keypo-signer-cli) — macOS only
cd keypo-signer-cli && swift build
cd keypo-signer-cli && swift test

# Foundry (keypo-account) — requires Foundry
cd keypo-account && forge build
cd keypo-account && forge test -vvv
```

### Linting

```bash
cd keypo-wallet && cargo fmt --check
cd keypo-wallet && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

## Documentation

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the documentation index and coding conventions.

## Integration Tests

Integration tests require secrets in `.env` at the repo root and access to Base Sepolia. They are marked `#[ignore]` in CI and run locally:

```bash
cd keypo-wallet && cargo test -- --ignored --test-threads=1
```

The `--test-threads=1` flag prevents funder wallet nonce conflicts.

## Deployments

| Chain | Contract | Address |
|---|---|---|
| Base Sepolia (84532) | KeypoAccount | [`0x6d1566f9aAcf9c06969D7BF846FA090703A38E43`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x6d1566f9aacf9c06969d7bf846fa090703a38e43) |

The address is deterministic (CREATE2) and identical across all chains.

## Balance Query Files

The `balance` command accepts `--query <file.json>` for structured queries:

```json
{
  "chains": [84532],
  "tokens": {
    "include": ["ETH", "0xUSDC_ADDRESS"],
    "min_balance": "0.001"
  },
  "format": "table",
  "sort_by": "balance"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `chains` | Array of chain IDs to query |
| `tokens.include` | Token list — `"ETH"` for native, contract addresses for ERC-20 |
| `tokens.min_balance` | Hide balances below this threshold |
| `format` | Output format: `table`, `json`, `csv` |
| `sort_by` | Sort order: `balance`, `chain`, `token` |

## Environment

### Config file (preferred)

The CLI reads endpoints from `~/.keypo/config.toml`, created by `keypo-wallet init`:

```toml
[network]
rpc_url = "https://sepolia.base.org"
bundler_url = "https://api.pimlico.io/v2/84532/rpc?apikey=..."
paymaster_url = "https://api.pimlico.io/v2/84532/rpc?apikey=..."
paymaster_policy_id = "sp_clever_unus"
```

### Resolution precedence

The CLI resolves each URL/setting with a 4-tier precedence:

1. **CLI flag** (`--rpc`, `--bundler`, `--paymaster`, `--paymaster-policy`)
2. **Environment variable** (`KEYPO_RPC_URL`, `KEYPO_BUNDLER_URL`, `KEYPO_PAYMASTER_URL`, `KEYPO_PAYMASTER_POLICY_ID`)
3. **Config file** (`~/.keypo/config.toml`)
4. **Error** (if none of the above provide a value)

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEYPO_RPC_URL` | Standard RPC endpoint |
| `KEYPO_BUNDLER_URL` | ERC-4337 bundler endpoint |
| `KEYPO_PAYMASTER_URL` | ERC-7677 paymaster endpoint |
| `KEYPO_PAYMASTER_POLICY_ID` | Paymaster sponsorship policy ID |
| `TEST_FUNDER_PRIVATE_KEY` | If set, `setup` auto-funds the new account (read directly from env) |

### `.env` file (Foundry / integration tests)

The `.env` file at the repo root is used by Foundry and integration tests, not by the CLI directly. Variables like `PIMLICO_API_KEY`, `BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`, `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `BASESCAN_API_KEY` live there. Foundry auto-loads `.env` via a symlink (`keypo-account/.env` -> `../.env`).
