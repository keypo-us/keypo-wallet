# keypo-cli

Never give your agents access to your sensitive information. 

Hardware-bound key management and encrypted secret storage, powered by Mac Secure Enclave and passkeys. Local-first architecture so you never rely on a cloud provider, and no one can extract your keys or your secrets: not your agent and not even Apple. 

## Two CLI Tools

| CLI | Description |
|---|---|
| **`keypo-signer`** | The core product — Secure Enclave P-256 key management, encrypted vault, iCloud backup. Create keys, sign digests, store and inject secrets. |
| **`keypo-wallet`** | Optional extension for on-chain use — adds ERC-4337 smart account delegation, bundler submission, and gas sponsorship. Builds on `keypo-signer`. |

## Install

```bash
# Core tool — key management + encrypted vault
brew install keypo-us/tap/keypo-signer

# Also available: adds smart account + bundler (includes keypo-signer)
brew install keypo-us/tap/keypo-wallet
```

Run `keypo-signer --help` or `keypo-wallet --help` after installing to see available commands.

## Prerequisites

- **macOS with Apple Silicon** — required for Secure Enclave signing
- **Rust 1.91+** — only needed if building keypo-wallet from source ([install](https://rustup.rs/))

## Getting Started: keypo-signer

### Create a signing key

```bash
keypo-signer create --label my-key --policy open
```

Policy options: `open` (no auth), `passcode` (device passcode), `biometric` (Touch ID).

### Sign a digest

```bash
keypo-signer sign --label my-key --digest 0x<32-byte-hex>
```

### Encrypted vault

Store secrets encrypted by Secure Enclave keys. Secrets never exist on disk in plaintext.

```bash
# Initialize vault encryption keys
keypo-signer vault init --label my-vault

# Store and retrieve secrets
keypo-signer vault set --label my-vault --name API_KEY --value sk-...
keypo-signer vault get --label my-vault --name API_KEY

# Run a command with secrets injected as environment variables
keypo-signer vault exec --label my-vault -- env
# or
keypo-signer vault exec --label my-vault -- sh -c 'echo $API_KEY'

# Import from .env file
keypo-signer vault import --label my-vault --file .env
```

The `vault exec` workflow is designed for AI agents — inject secrets into tool processes without exposing them in config files or shell history.

### Vault backup

Back up vault secrets to iCloud Drive with two-factor encryption (iCloud Keychain synced key + User passphrase). Restore on any Mac signed into the same iCloud account.

```bash
# Create an encrypted backup (generates passphrase on first run)
keypo-signer vault backup

# Check backup status
keypo-signer vault backup info

# Restore on a new Mac
keypo-signer vault restore
```

Store your backup passphrase at [keypo.io/app](https://www.keypo.io/app) or write it down in a safe place.

## Getting Started: keypo-wallet (optional extension)

keypo-wallet is an optional extension for users who want on-chain smart account capabilities. It turns a Mac into a programmable hardware wallet, building on `keypo-signer` for key management and adding smart account delegation, bundler submission, and gas sponsorship.

### 0. Prerequisites

- An RPC provider URL (e.g., `https://sepolia.base.org`)
- A bundler API key/URL (Pimlico, CDP, Alchemy — any ERC-4337 bundler)
- A paymaster API key/URL (optional — for gas sponsorship)
- A small amount of testnet ETH (~$1) for initial setup gas

### 1. Install

```bash
# Via Homebrew (installs both keypo-wallet and keypo-signer)
brew install keypo-us/tap/keypo-wallet

# Upgrading from keypo-signer? Uninstall it first — keypo-wallet bundles both binaries.
# brew uninstall keypo-signer

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/keypo-us/keypo-cli.git
cd keypo-cli/keypo-wallet && cargo install --path .
# (keypo-signer must be installed separately: brew install keypo-us/tap/keypo-signer)
```

### 2. Configure endpoints

```bash
keypo-wallet init
# Prompts for RPC URL, bundler URL, and optional paymaster URL.
# Saves to ~/.keypo/config.toml.
```

### 3. Set up a smart account

```bash
keypo-wallet setup --key my-key --key-policy open
```

Signs an EIP-7702 delegation to the KeypoAccount contract and registers your P-256 public key as the owner. The account record is saved to `~/.keypo/accounts.json`.

**Key policies:** `open` (no auth — best for AI agents), `passcode` (device passcode), `biometric` (Touch ID).

**Funding:** Setup requires a small amount of ETH for gas. The CLI prints the address and waits for you to send ETH.

### 4. Check wallet configuration

```bash
keypo-wallet wallet-info --key my-key   # Full info with live on-chain balance
keypo-wallet info --key my-key           # Local state only (no RPC call)
keypo-wallet balance --key my-key        # ETH balance
keypo-wallet balance --key my-key --token 0xTokenAddress  # ERC-20 balance
```

### 5. Send a transaction

```bash
# Send 0.001 ETH (value is in wei)
keypo-wallet send --key my-key --to 0xRecipientAddress --value 1000000000000000
```

If `paymaster_url` is configured, transactions are gas-sponsored automatically. Add `--no-paymaster` to pay gas from the wallet's ETH balance.

## Demos

### Checkout demo

The [checkout demo](demo/checkout/) shows `vault exec` in a real-world scenario: an AI agent completes a Shopify purchase while your credit card stays locked behind Touch ID. The agent never sees your card details — they're injected into a headless browser process that the agent can't inspect.

```bash
# After setup (see demo/checkout/README.md):
demo/checkout/run-with-vault.sh https://shop.keypo.io/products/keypo-logo-art
# Touch ID prompt appears → approve → order placed
```

Shipping addresses are stored in the vault's open tier (no auth), card details in the biometric tier (Touch ID). No database, no API server — everything flows through `vault exec`.

### Hermes checkout demo

The [Hermes checkout demo](demo/hermes-checkout/) shows `vault exec` in a real-world scenartio with Hermes, an open-source AI agent built by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com/). This demo is an AI shopping agent with comparison shopping, taste profiles, scheduled purchases, and Telegram integration. Hermes uses the Shopify Catalog MCP server to search across stores and the `keypo-approvald` approval daemon for Touch ID-gated checkout.

```bash
# Start the approval daemon (listens on Unix socket)
keypo-approvald &

# Ask Hermes to comparison-shop
hermes "Find me the best price on a mechanical keyboard under $150"

# Scheduled shopping with taste profiles
hermes "Remind me to buy coffee beans every 2 weeks — I like medium roast, single origin"
```

The agent never sees card details — all payment flows through `vault exec` behind Touch ID. See [demo/hermes-checkout/README.md](demo/hermes-checkout/README.md) for full setup.

## Documentation

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the documentation index and coding conventions.

## Deployments

| Chain | Contract | Address |
|---|---|---|
| Base Sepolia (84532) | KeypoAccount | [`0x6d1566f9aAcf9c06969D7BF846FA090703A38E43`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x6d1566f9aacf9c06969d7bf846fa090703a38e43) |

The address is deterministic (CREATE2) and identical across all chains.

## keypo-wallet Configuration

The sections below apply to keypo-wallet only. keypo-signer has no external configuration — it works standalone.

### Config file (preferred)

The CLI reads endpoints from `~/.keypo/config.toml`, created by `keypo-wallet init`:

```toml
[network]
rpc_url = "https://sepolia.base.org"
bundler_url = "https://api.pimlico.io/v2/84532/rpc?apikey=..."
paymaster_url = "https://api.pimlico.io/v2/84532/rpc?apikey=..."
paymaster_policy_id = "sp_clever_unus"
```

### Resolution precedence

1. **CLI flag** (`--rpc`, `--bundler`, `--paymaster`, `--paymaster-policy`)
2. **Environment variable** (`KEYPO_RPC_URL`, `KEYPO_BUNDLER_URL`, `KEYPO_PAYMASTER_URL`, `KEYPO_PAYMASTER_POLICY_ID`)
3. **Config file** (`~/.keypo/config.toml`)
4. **Error** (if none of the above provide a value)

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEYPO_RPC_URL` | Standard RPC endpoint |
| `KEYPO_BUNDLER_URL` | ERC-4337 bundler endpoint |
| `KEYPO_PAYMASTER_URL` | ERC-7677 paymaster endpoint |
| `KEYPO_PAYMASTER_POLICY_ID` | Paymaster sponsorship policy ID |
| `TEST_FUNDER_PRIVATE_KEY` | If set, `setup` auto-funds the new account (read directly from env) |

### `.env` file (Foundry / integration tests)

The `.env` file at the repo root is used by Foundry and integration tests, not by the CLI directly. Variables like `PIMLICO_API_KEY`, `BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`, `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `BASESCAN_API_KEY` live there. Foundry auto-loads `.env` via a symlink (`keypo-account/.env` -> `../.env`).

### Balance query files

The `balance` command accepts `--query <file.json>` for structured queries:

```json
{
  "chains": [84532],
  "tokens": {
    "include": ["ETH", "0xUSDC_ADDRESS"],
    "min_balance": "0.001"
  },
  "format": "table",
  "sort_by": "balance"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `chains` | Array of chain IDs to query |
| `tokens.include` | Token list — `"ETH"` for native, contract addresses for ERC-20 |
| `tokens.min_balance` | Hide balances below this threshold |
| `format` | Output format: `table`, `json`, `csv` |
| `sort_by` | Sort order: `balance`, `chain`, `token` |

### Integration tests

Integration tests require secrets in `.env` at the repo root and access to Base Sepolia. They are marked `#[ignore]` in CI and run locally:

```bash
cd keypo-wallet && cargo test -- --ignored --test-threads=1
```

The `--test-threads=1` flag prevents funder wallet nonce conflicts.

## Skills

This repo includes [Claude Code skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) that teach AI agents how to use keypo-cli. Install all skills with:

```bash
npx skills add keypo-us/keypo-cli --full-depth
```

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `keypo-wallet` | Core wallet operations — setup, send, batch, balance queries |
| `portfolio-tracker` | Discover all ERC-20 token balances via Alchemy Portfolio API |
| `contract-learner` | Generate a SKILL.md for any verified smart contract |
| `weth-base-sepolia` | Example generated skill — interact with WETH on Base Sepolia |

Generated contract skills live in `skills/contracts/`. Use the `contract-learner` skill to create new ones from any verified contract address.

### Setup for vault exec

After installing skills, add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md` so the agent knows to inject secrets via the vault instead of using plaintext `.env` files:

```markdown
## Secrets

This project uses `keypo-signer` for secret management. Never use plaintext `.env` files. Always inject secrets via vault exec:

\```bash
keypo-signer vault exec --env .env.example -- <command>
\```
```
