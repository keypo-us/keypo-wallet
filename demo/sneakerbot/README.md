# Keypo Checkout Demo

Ask Claude Code to buy something from a Shopify store. Your credit card details
stay locked in the Keypo vault — the agent never sees them. When it's time to
pay, Touch ID appears on your Mac and you approve the transaction with your
fingerprint.

## Test Store

This demo is pre-configured to use a test Shopify store with test products
(**no real money is charged**). You can use Shopify's test card number
`4242 4242 4242 4242` with any future expiry and any CVV.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Store** | `keypo-store-2.myshopify.com` |
| **Store password** | `rowben` |
| **Test product** | [Keypo Logo Art](https://keypo-store-2.myshopify.com/products/keypo-logo-art?variant=44740698996759) ($1.00) |
| **Test card** | `4242424242424242`, any exp, any CVV |

The store is password-protected (Shopify's test mode). The bot handles the
password gate automatically using the `STORE_PASSWORD` vault secret.

The checkout logic is generic Shopify — to point it at a different store,
just change the product URL and store password.

## How It Works

You say something like **"Buy the Keypo Logo Art"** in Claude Code. The agent
creates a checkout task, then runs a wrapper script that calls
`keypo-signer vault exec`. The vault decrypts your card details (Touch ID
required), injects them into a headless browser process, and completes the
Shopify checkout. You get an order confirmation email from Shopify.

```

Claude Code cannot inspect the child process. The agent sees the process's
stdout (status messages like "Entering card details") and its exit code —
nothing else. The secret values exist only inside the child process.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **macOS** with Apple Silicon (Secure Enclave required)
- **[keypo-signer](https://github.com/keypo-us/keypo-wallet/tree/main/keypo-signer)** installed with vault initialized
- **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** installed
- **Node 18** (via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- **PostgreSQL** (via Homebrew or Docker)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/keypo-us/keypo-wallet.git
cd keypo-wallet/demo/sneakerbot
```

If you already have the repo, make sure the submodule is initialized:

```bash
git submodule update --init demo/sneakerbot/bot
```

### 2. Start PostgreSQL

Using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install postgresql@14
brew services start postgresql@14
```

Or using Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Create the database

```bash
createdb sneakerbot_demo
psql sneakerbot_demo -c "CREATE USER sneakerbot WITH PASSWORD 'localdev';"
psql sneakerbot_demo -c "GRANT ALL ON DATABASE sneakerbot_demo TO sneakerbot;"
psql sneakerbot_demo -c "GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO sneakerbot;"
```

> If using Docker, the database is created automatically — skip this step.

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
cd bot
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
npm install
```

### 5. Run migrations and seed data

```bash
NODE_ENV=local npx knex migrate:latest
NODE_ENV=local npx knex seed:run
cd ..
```

### 6. Initialize the vault

If you haven't already set up the Keypo vault:

```bash
keypo-signer vault init
```

Now import your secrets. Create two temporary files:

**.env.open** — non-sensitive config (open tier, no auth required):
```
PORT=8080
DB_USERNAME=sneakerbot
DB_PASSWORD=localdev
DB_NAME=sneakerbot_demo
DB_PORT=5432
DB_HOST=localhost
NODE_ENV=local
STORE_PASSWORD=rowben
```

**.env.card** — card details (biometric tier, Touch ID required).
For the test store, use Shopify's test card:
```
CARD_NUMBER=4242424242424242
NAME_ON_CARD=Test Buyer
EXPIRATION_MONTH=12
EXPIRATION_YEAR=28
SECURITY_CODE=123
```

> To use a real card instead, replace the values above with your actual card
> details. The biometric vault ensures they can only be accessed with Touch ID.

Import them into the vault:

```bash
keypo-signer vault import .env.open --policy open
keypo-signer vault import .env.card --policy biometric
```

Delete the temporary files — your secrets are now in the vault:

```bash
rm .env.open .env.card
```

Verify everything is stored:

```bash
keypo-signer vault list
# Should show 8 secrets in "open" and 5 secrets in "biometric"
```

### 7. Lock down the code

This prevents the agent from modifying the checkout scripts to exfiltrate
your card details. See [Tamper protection](#tamper-protection) for why this
matters.

```bash
sudo chown -R root:wheel run-with-vault.sh bot/
sudo chmod -R a+rX,go-w run-with-vault.sh bot/
```

### 8. Try it

Start the API server:

```bash
cd bot
NODE_ENV=local node ./scripts/start-api-server.js &
cd ..
```

Open Claude Code in the project directory:

```bash
claude
```

Then ask it to buy something:

```
> Buy the Keypo Logo Art
```

Touch ID will appear — authenticate, and the agent completes the purchase.
You'll get an order confirmation email from Shopify.

## Usage

Once set up, the typical flow is:

1. Start Postgres and the API server (if not already running)
2. Open Claude Code in this directory
3. Ask it to buy a product (e.g., "Buy the Keypo Logo Art")
4. Approve with Touch ID when prompted
5. Check your email for the order confirmation

To shut everything down:

```bash
# Stop the API server
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill

# Stop Postgres (Homebrew)
brew services stop postgresql@14

# Or stop Postgres (Docker)
docker compose down
```

## Security Model

Your card details are protected by three layers:

1. **Biometric vault** — card secrets are encrypted with a Secure Enclave key
   that requires Touch ID to access. The agent cannot decrypt them without your
   fingerprint.

2. **Process isolation** — `vault exec` injects secrets into the child process
   environment only. They are never written to disk, logged, or returned to the
   agent. The agent sees stdout from the checkout process, which only contains
   status messages ("Entering card details"), not the values themselves.

3. **Tamper protection** — the wrapper script and bot code are root-owned, so
   the agent cannot modify them. See below.

### Tamper protection

An AI agent with file-write access could theoretically modify the checkout
scripts to exfiltrate secrets from `process.env` at runtime. There are three
files in the trust chain that must be protected:

1. **`run-with-vault.sh`** — pins the child command to `node ./scripts/start-task.js`.
   Without this, the agent could call `vault exec` with an arbitrary command
   like `env` or `bash -c 'echo $CARD_NUMBER'` and read secrets from stdout.
2. **`bot/scripts/start-task.js`** — the entry point that runs inside `vault exec`
   with secrets in `process.env`. If modified, it could log secrets before
   executing checkout logic.
3. **`bot/`** (all JS files) — any file in the execution chain (`cluster.js`,
   `shopify.js`, etc.) has access to `process.env` and could be modified to
   exfiltrate values.

Lock all three down by setting root ownership:

```bash
sudo chown -R root:wheel run-with-vault.sh bot/
sudo chmod -R a+rX,go-w run-with-vault.sh bot/
```

This works because Claude Code runs as your user and cannot modify root-owned
files. The agent can still *execute* `run-with-vault.sh` (it's world-readable
and executable), but cannot alter the wrapper, the entry point, or any code in
the execution chain.

When you need to update the bot code, temporarily reclaim ownership:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) run-with-vault.sh bot/
# ... make changes ...
sudo chown -R root:wheel run-with-vault.sh bot/
sudo chmod -R a+rX,go-w run-with-vault.sh bot/
```

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `run-with-vault.sh` | Wrapper: `vault exec --env` → checkout process |
| `.env.vault-template` | Key-name manifest for `vault exec --env` |
| `SKILL.md` | Claude Code agent skill definition |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Postgres-only compose (alternative to Homebrew) |
| `seed-data/` | Address and site reference data |
| `bot/` | Checkout bot (fork of [SneakerBot](https://github.com/samc621/SneakerBot)) |
