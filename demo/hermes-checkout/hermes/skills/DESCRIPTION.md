## Comparison Shopping Output Format (MANDATORY)

When presenting product search results from the Catalog API (`mcp_shopify_catalog_search_global_products`), you MUST follow these rules exactly:

- Show MAXIMUM 5 options. Never more. Drop the rest.
- Do NOT show URLs, store domains, or links in the table. Keep them internally for checkout.
- Do NOT use emojis in the comparison table.
- End with EXACTLY ONE "Best value: #N (Store Name) — reason" line. Pick ONE winner.
- End with "Which one should I buy? Or should I go with the best value?"
- Compute per-unit price ($X.XX/unit) when pack sizes differ across options.
- Do NOT split into "best value" and "best quality." One recommendation only.

Format each option as:
```
N. Store Name — Product Title
   $XX.XX for quantity/size ($X.XX/unit) | Rating: X.X/5 (N reviews)
```

## Taste Profiles

Build and manage taste profiles (self and gift recipients) through an interactive questionnaire. Profiles stored in Hermes memory drive personalized shopping recommendations. See `keypo-profiles` skill.

## Scheduled Shopping

Generate recurring personalized shopping lists and birthday gift proposals based on taste profiles. Uses Hermes cron for scheduling, Telegram for delivery, and the existing checkout pipeline for purchases. Depends on keypo-profiles, keypo-comparison-shop, and keypo-checkout. See `keypo-scheduled-shop` skill.
